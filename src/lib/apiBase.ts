 * and the bundle is on the device - a relative `/api/login` would resolve to
 * the phone itself, where nothing is listening, and every backend call fails
 * with a confusing network error rather than an HTTP status.
 *
 * So native builds get an absolute base. Override with VITE_API_BASE_URL to
 * point a test build at a LAN dev server instead of production.
