/**
 * The announcement document schema.
 *
 * Formatting is stored the way Telegram stores it: a plain-text string plus a
 * list of ranges that carry marks. NOT html, and not markdown.
 *
 * That choice is load-bearing in three ways:
 *
 *   1. No sanitiser. Rendering slices the string at entity boundaries and emits
 *      React elements, so nothing ever reaches `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. This
 *      app has no sanitiser dependency and storing HTML from a moderator-authored
 *      field would have been the first XSS surface in it.
 *   2. The push-notification function (functions/index.js) reads `text` and
 *      `content`. Those stay plain strings, so a bold word never leaks a `**`
 *      into a notification body.
 *   3. Offsets are UTF-16 code units, which is exactly what Telegram's
 *      MessageEntity uses - so the phase-2 channel mirror is a field rename
 *      rather than a re-encode.
 *
 * A document with no `richBlocks` renders from `text` as unstyled plain text,
 * which is what every pre-existing post and every bot-authored post looks like.
