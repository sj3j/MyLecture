// Regenerate every launcher icon, notification icon, splash image and web icon
// from one logo master.
//
// Why this exists instead of `npx capacitor-assets generate`:
//
//  1. assets/Normallogo.png is not a transparent logo. It is an opaque square
//     with the mark rendered on a flat WHITE ground. capacitor-assets takes that
//     at face value and hands it to the adaptive icon's foreground layer, so the
//     white ground rides along and shows up as a box behind the mark on the
//     launcher and on the Android 12+ splash. Stripping the ground is step one
//     here, and no amount of layer/inset tweaking substitutes for it.
//  2. That tool also insets the adaptive icon's BACKGROUND layer by 16.7%, so
//     the plate never reaches the edge of the 108dp canvas. Launchers that
//     force a shape then wrap the icon in a plate of their own to compensate.
//  3. It writes the adaptive layers at LEGACY densities -- 192px at xxxhdpi,
//     where the adaptive canvas is 108dp and xxxhdpi is 4x, so the correct size
//     is 432px. The system upscales 2.25x and the mark comes out soft.
//
// Everything is derived from the mark's own bounding box after the ground comes
// off, so the result does not depend on how much padding the source carries.
// Re-run after replacing the master:
//
//     npm run icons

 * agreed with none of them, and since the old foreground was a white glyph the
