/**
 * The one thing a student keeps when the year is wiped.
 *
 * The year-end wipe throws away the raw material - every MCQ answer, every
 * question-bank answer, every lecture. This runs FIRST and reduces all of it to
 * three numbers per student, written to `users/{uid}/yearHistory/{yearLabel}`:
 * their score, how many MCQs they solved, and how many bank questions they
 * answered. Nothing else about the year survives.
 *
 * Ordering matters twice over:
 *   - run this BEFORE `startNewSeason`, which zeroes `userMCQStats`
 *   - run it BEFORE `wipeYear`, which deletes `userBankAnswers`
 * Either one first leaves this reading zeroes.
 *
 * Lives in shared/ for the usual reason: server.ts and api/index.ts are
 * divergent copies and vercel.json routes production to api/index.ts, so logic
 * in only one of them silently never runs.
