/**
 * End-of-year progression: what to ask a student, and what their answer means.
 *
 * Pure - no Firebase - so the client and the server compute the same answer from
 * the same inputs. The server recomputes `nextProgressionStep` before accepting
 * a submission, because the client is not trusted about which question it was
 * showing.
 *
 * The flow:
 *
 *   results published  ->  نجحت ? / دور ثاني ?
 *                            |          |
 *                       promoted    awaiting_resit, asked nothing more until
 *                                   the resit results date passes, then:
 *                                     نجحت / تحميل / رسبت
 *
 * Everything is keyed on the calendar's `yearLabel`, so next year's calendar
 * reopens the cycle for everyone without any migration.
