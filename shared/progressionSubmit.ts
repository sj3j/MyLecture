/**
 * Recording a student's progression answer. Server-side only.
 *
 * This CANNOT be a client write, for two independent reasons:
 *
 * 1. syncUserStage (api/index.ts, mirrored in server.ts) copies
 *    `students/{email}.stageId` onto the user doc on EVERY login. Writing only
 *    `users` - which is what the old ProgressionModal did - is silently
 *    reverted the next time the student signs in.
 * 2. `students/{email}` is admin-write-only in firestore.rules, so the student
 *    cannot fix (1) themselves.
 *
 * The round is recomputed here rather than trusted from the request, so a
 * student cannot skip to the three-way question and promote themselves early.
