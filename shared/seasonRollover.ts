/**
 * The automated season rollover: the one piece of the calendar system that writes.
 *
 * Pausing and resuming do NOT live here - those are derived from the date by
 * resolvePhase(), on every client and on every request, so the app behaves
 * correctly whether or not this ever runs. What this adds is the archive: when
 * a term's season is over, it captures both leaderboards into every student's
 * profile and zeroes them for the next term.
 *
 * Idempotent per term via `app_settings/streak.seasonClosedFor`, so it is safe
 * to call from a daily cron, from the admin's manual button, and twice in the
 * same minute. Also self-healing: a term stays closable however long after the
 * boundary the rollover finally fires.
 *
 * Shared by server.ts and api/index.ts for the usual reason - vercel.json routes
 * production /api/* to api/index.ts, so anything defined in only one of them
 * silently never runs where it matters.
