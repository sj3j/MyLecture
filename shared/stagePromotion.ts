/**
 * Moving a cohort from one stage to the next.
 *
 * Split into a read-only `planPromotion` and a write-only `applyPromotion` so
 * the whole thing can be dry-run and reviewed before anything is committed.
 *
 * Three things here are load-bearing and easy to get wrong:
 *
 * 1. `students/{email}.stageId` must be written, not just `users/{uid}.stageId`.
 *    syncUserStage (api/index.ts, mirrored in server.ts) copies the students
 *    value onto the user doc on EVERY login, so updating only `users` is
 *    silently reverted the next time the student signs in.
 * 2. The group has to go to both `students.subgroup` and `users.group`. They
 *    hold the same "C2" value and nothing syncs them: the first drives the
 *    admin roster, the second gates the app (src/App.tsx forces the onboarding
 *    screen when it is missing).
 * 3. User docs are found by email QUERY, not by id. Password-login uids are the
 *    lowercased email but Google-login uids are not, and an email can have more
 *    than one user doc (hence the merge-duplicates tool in StudentManagement).
