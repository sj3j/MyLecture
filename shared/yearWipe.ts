/**
 * The year-end wipe: emptying every stage's content so the next year starts clean.
 *
 * This is the most destructive operation in the app. It is split into a
 * read-only `planYearWipe`, an `exportYear` that snapshots what is about to go,
 * and `wipeYear` which does the deleting - the same plan/apply shape as
 * shared/stagePromotion.ts, so the whole thing can be dry-run and reviewed
 * before anything is committed.
 *
 * ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING. The caller must run, in this order:
 *   1. summariseYear()   - shared/yearSummary.ts, while the answer data still exists
 *   2. startNewSeason()  - shared/seasonReset.ts, archives the leaderboard cards
 *   3. exportYear()      - snapshot
 *   4. wipeYear()        - delete
 * Any other order silently archives zeroes.
 *
 * WHAT SURVIVES, and why each one matters:
 *   questionBank    - the whole point; ministry/past-year/professor questions, not regenerable
 *   students        - the login table; wiping it locks everyone out
 *   users           - accounts, roles, subscription state
 *   stages, subjects- signup and promotion both hard-fail without them
 *   exam grades     - the degrees subcollections; irreplaceable academic record
 *   adminLogs       - append-only audit by design
 *   semesterArchives, streakHistory, mcqHistory, yearHistory - the history we just wrote
